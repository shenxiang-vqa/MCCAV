 Multimodal context-aware consistency alignment plays a critical role in vision-language tasks. However, existing methods exhibit limited capability in modeling intra-modal contextual structures, making it challenging to effectively integrate hierarchical contextual information and capture long-range semantic dependencies. These shortcomings restrict the consistency and robustness of cross-modal alignment, particularly in complex scenarios such as multi-step reasoning and semantically ambiguous expressions. To address this issue, we propose a Multimodal Context-aware Consistency Alignment (MCCA) framework to alleviate key bottlenecks in cross-modal semantic alignment. The framework enhances the language encoder with diverse context-aware mechanisms to capture multi-level linguistic semantics, and embeds both relative and absolute positional information into the visual encoder to generate visual representations with rich spatial contextual awareness. Based on these representations, we design two complementary alignment strategies. The first leverages a radial basis function (RBF) kernel to model nonlinear similarities in high-dimensional semantic space, enabling the explicit capture of complex and implicit associations between linguistic tokens and image regions. The second employs an adaptive Jaccard similarity approach, which dynamically constructs semantic sets for language and vision, allowing the alignment process to flexibly adjust to the actual distribution of text-image pairs, thus improving robustness and generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets in visual question answering and visual grounding tasks demonstrate that our MCCA framework achieves new state-of-the-art results. Notably, it obtains accuracies of 72.08% on VQA-v2 and 99.33% on CLEVR, validating the effectiveness and superiority of MCCA in enhancing semantic consistency in cross-modal alignment.
